# Payment_Date_Prediction

**Objective:**
To develop a Machine Learning Model for predicting the payment date of an invoice upon its creation in the system.

**Workflow:**

1. **Acquiring Data:**
   - The datasets were provided by our internship host, [HighRadius](https://www.highradius.com/).

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize patterns, and identify potential features.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engineer relevant features that could enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

5. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Prepare the data for model training by encoding categorical variables, scaling features, etc.

6. **Model Development:**
   - Build a machine learning model suitable for predicting payment dates.

7. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model on a portion of the dataset to learn patterns and relationships.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune if necessary.

9. **Prediction:**
   - Apply the trained model to predict payment dates for new invoices.

10. **Validation:**
    - Validate predictions against actual payment dates to assess model accuracy and reliability.

11. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the model for practical use, allowing it to predict payment dates in real-world scenarios.

12. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Implement continuous monitoring to ensure model effectiveness and make updates if needed.

**Note:**
Adjust and customize each step based on specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset.
